Various analyses on the times it has taken to get a second swim (i.e., top-16) at Men's NCAA Division 1 Swimming and Diving Championships.

I have the data for the 8th place and 16th place prelimiary times for every individual event for the Men's NCAA Division Swimming Championshps going back to 2005. The top-8 in prelims go on to swim in the "A-final" and no swimmer in this final can finish lower than eighth unless he is disqualified. The 9-16 in prelims swim in the "B-final" and can finish no higher than 9th, but also still no lower than 16th unless he is disqualified. Please note that, in the case of ties for 8th or 16th, a swim-off is requred at the competition to determine which final, if any, the swimmer swims in; I only included the actual prelim time for 8th/16th and have no information about the swim off. Please also note that, in the case where no one places 8th or 16th (for example, when there is a two-swimmer tie for 7th), I used the time that of the next highest place.

I decided to use these times as opposed to winning times as these should be much more stable year over year. Furthermore, I am more interested in how the "depth" of the competition has changed as opposed to the absolute "top-end" of it.

I performed various analyses on the swimming data as you will see in the project. I kind of let the project guide me, with comments showing my surprise/confirmation at initial thoughts.

This is a passion project.

This is my first time doing my own personal coding project (i.e., not school or work related) as well as my first time using Python (and thus also PANDAS/NUMPY/MATPLOTLIB.PYLOT/MATH/SEABORN/JUPYTER). I want to get better at Python, and I love competitive swimming, so I figured what better project?

Fun first Python project. I think my next project will involved something with lots of data (perhaps still swimming, I would just need to learn how to Webscrape.)
