# NCAA-Men-s-Division-1-Second-Swim-Statistics
Various analyses on the times it has taken to get a second swim (i.e., top-16) at Men's NCAA Division 1 Swimming and Diving Championships.

I took the times it has historically taken (2005-present) to qualify for the top-8 and top-16 for each men's individual swimming event at NCAA Division 1 Swimming Championships. From here, I ran various analyses on it.

This is a passion project.

This is my first time doing my own personal coding project (i.e., not school or work related) as well as my first time using Python (and thus also PANDAS/NUMPY/MATPLOTLIB.PYLOT/MATH/SEABORN). I want to get better at Python, and I love competitive swimming, so I figured what better project?

I performed various analyses on the swimming data as you will see in the project. I kind of let the project guide me, with comments showing my surprise/confirmation at initial thoughts.

Fun first Python project. I think my next project will involved something with lots of data (perhaps still swimming, I would just need to learn how to Webscrape.)
